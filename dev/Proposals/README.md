## Purpose

These documents support the development of standardized guidelines for completing the ADRG section when submitting analysis programs written in R to regulatory agencies. The work is part of the broader PHUSE initiative to facilitate open-source software use in regulatory submissions.

A key component of this work includes developing instructions for recreating the R analysis environment, which will be included as an appendix to the ADRG. These instructions are critical for ensuring reproducibility of R-based analyses in regulatory submissions.

## Status

**Current Phase:** Review and refinement\
**Next Milestone:** Presentation to ADRG PHUSE Working Group

## The Team {#sec-introducing-ourselves}

-   Members of the PHUSE Communication of Version Metadata Working Group
-   R developers in clinical programming
-   Collaborating with FDA and PHUSE ADRG Working Group
-   Our mission: Improve reproducibility and transparency in clinical trial analysis

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## I. Introduction

### Problem Statement & Objective {#sec-problem-statement--objective .small}

-   The **objective** of this project is to develop a new template or enhance the Analysis Data Reviewer’s Guide (ADRG) for open-source submissions.
-   The **aim** is to ensure consistent documentation of metadata pertaining to the versions of statistical packages and procedures, aligning with health authority expectations.
-   The **standardized template** will streamline the submission of clinical study metadata to health authorities as part of the regulatory review process.
-   **Benefits**: Improved reproducibility, transparency, and regulatory compliance

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Evolution of Statistical Programming in Clinical Trials

-   Transition from proprietary languages (SAS) to open-source (R, Python)
-   Growing adoption of R in clinical trials
-   Need for standardized documentation that accommodates both paradigms

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## II. Background and Context

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Purpose of Analysis Data Reviewer’s Guide (ADRG)

-   Provides FDA reviewers with context for analysis datasets and terminology.

-   Supplements information presented within the data folder (e.g., define.xml).

-   Includes a summary of ADaM and other submission documents:

    -   Protocol
    -   Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP)
    -   Clinical Study Report
    -   Define.xml

::: notes
-   Section 2 will be an open discussion/workshop\
-   Presenters will show an example of an ADRG for a SAS reported study and an example of R reported study\
-   Compare and contrast - discuss what information is needed for an R submission

The ADRG provides FDA reviewers with context for analysis datasets and terminology, received as part of a regulatory product submission, additional to what is presented within the data folder (i.e., define.xml). The ADRG also provides a summary of ADaM other submission documentation (e.g., the protocol, statistical analysis plan (SAP), clinical study report, define.xml) in order to provide FDA reviewers with a single point of orientation to the analysis datasets. It should be noted that the submission of an ADRG does not eliminate the requirement to submit a complete and informative define.xml file corresponding to the analysis datasets.

-   An ADRG for clinical data should be called an ADRG and the document should be a PDF file ‘adrg.pdf’ upon submission.

### Documentation of versions of statistical packages and procedures

#### Proprietary Statistical Programming Languages

-   The version metadata of the statistical procedures/functions has been documented within the Statistical Analysis Plan with a general statement of software and version used (other companies may use other documentation)
-   Detailed information has been added to the Analysis Data Reviewer’s Guide (ADRG). The ADRG has a section where the programming software version and functions are specified

::: notes
Open an example of ADRG and highlight section where software related information is needed.

### Documentation of versions of statistical packages and procedures

#### Open-Source software

Challenges

-   Package dependencies management
-   Version control complexities
-   Reproducibility concerns across environments
-   Limited standardization in how R analyses are documented

::: notes
-   Open Current R-based submissions and compare to SAS reported study ADRG
-   Current ADRG template primarily designed around SAS paradigm
-   Need for updated approach that encompasses open-source practices
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## III. Collaboration with FDA and PHUSE ADRG WG

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Stakeholder Engagement

-   Ongoing discussions with FDA reviewers
-   Collaboration with PHUSE ADRG Working Group
-   Industry input from R users in pharma companies
-   Gathering diverse perspectives on requirements

::: notes
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Key Findings from Consultations

-   Need for systematic documentation of R packages and versions
-   Importance of environment reproducibility
-   Gaps in current ADRG template for R-specific metadata
-   Desire for automated solutions to reduce manual documentation burden

::: notes
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## IV. Draft Supplementary Guidelines for R Deliverables

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Key ADRG Sections Requiring Updates

-   Section 7: Submissions of Programs
    -   ADaM Programs
    -   Analysis Output Programs
    -   Macro Programs
-   New section: R Environment Specifications

::: notes
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Proposed Approach

-   Create an ADRG R supplementary completion guideline
-   Create dedicated R package (adrg) for standardized documentation
    -   Automate extraction of R environment metadata
    -   Generate standardized ADRG sections for R analyses
-   Ensure compatibility with existing ADRG template

::: notes
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Ensuring Reproducibility

-   Environment snapshot creation
-   Package dependency tracking (renv integration)
-   Docker container specifications (when applicable)
-   Platform independence considerations

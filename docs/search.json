    "text": "Introduction and review of problem statement\nNote: In the following discussion for Proprietary Statistical Programming Languages, SAS will be used as an example and for Open Source, R will be used as an example.\nAs per the Study Data Technical Conformance Guide (version 5.7) section 4.1.2.10 on software Programs, Sponsors are required to provide the source code used to generate all ADaM datasets, tables, and figures linked to primary and secondary efficacy analyses. The source code should be submitted in single byte ASCII text format, with details of the specific software (version and operating system) specified in the ADRG.\nSection 2.3 of the Study Data Technical Conformance Guide (version 5.7) highlights the significance of the Analysis Data Reviewer’s Guide (ADRG) as a crucial component of a standards-compliant analysis data submission for clinical trials. The ADRG offers FDA reviewers essential context for analysis datasets and terminology within regulatory product submissions. While the guide does not specify a specific template, an example can be accessed at https://advance.phuse.global/display/WEL/Deliverables. It’s important to note that the ADRG intentionally replicates key information from other submission documents (e.g., protocol, statistical analysis plan (SAP), clinical study report, define.xml) to provide FDA reviewers with a centralized reference for the analysis datasets. Additionally, some sponsors also outline the software used for analysis in the SAP.\n\nProprietary Statistical Programming Languages\nWhen using Proprietary Statistical Programming Languages such as SAS, specifying the SAS version is adequate. Each SAS version validates and includes all procedures and functions within that version, obviating the need to detail versions of individual functions/procedures. The specified SAS version is deemed comprehensive, enabling regulatory authorities to rerun the submitted programs. Additionally, any custom functions developed by the sponsor should also be submitted.\nADRG Example 1: PhUSE ADRG Template Version\nPhUSE ADRG Template Version 2019-07-18 - section 7: Submission of Programs.\nsupporting text: All SAS programs for analysis datasets and primary and secondary efficacy results are submitted. They were all created on a SAS platform using version 9.3. The internal reference date used to create dates in ADaM datasets is January 1, 1960.\nADRG Example 2:\nSection 7: Submission of Programs supporting text: All programs for analysis datasets as well as primary safety and efficacy results are submitted as shown below. All programs were created on a SAS platform using 9.4.\n\n\nOpen-Source software\nThe emergence of Open-Source software brings new complexities. For instance, in R, while each version comes with base packages/functions, there can be distinct versions of non-base functions/packages. This presents two key issues:\n\nDocumenting the version of R and non-base packages used in the delivery (base R packages need not be specified as they are inherent to the R version). This also provides an opportunity to document custom functions, which is comparatively easier than in SAS.\nRecreating the programming environment.\n\nGiven that the submission using open source is still relatively new, it would greatly benefit the industry to have a common approach through industry guidance on the optimal way to submit this information.\nADRG Example 1: R Submission Pilot 3\nIn the R Submission Pilot 3 ADRG, section 7 addresses challenge 1 as follows:\n7.1 Description: The sponsor has provided all programs for analysis results. They are all created on a Linux platform using R version 4.2.3.\n7.4 Proprietary R Packages and 7.5 Open-source R Analysis Packages\nChallenge 2 is covered in 9.1 Appendix 1: Pilot 3 Installation and Usage.\nADRG Example 2: Novo Nordisk R submission\nNovo Nordisk has furnished a separate document, Instructions to programs in R, containing details on Submission files, Software requirements, Recreation of the R environment, and running the programs.\n\n\nQuestions/Mission for the WG\n\nMain\nRegarding Challenge 1 and Challenge 2:\n\nIs the ADRG the appropriate document to include the version of R and associated packages?\nShould this information be documented in the SAP as well?\nDo we require a separate document to complement the ADRG, addressing Challenge 1 and 2 as illustrated in the Novo Nordisk example?\n\n\n\nOther\nSituation: As per the Study Data Technical Conformance Guide, the ADRG for clinical data should be named ‘adrg.pdf’ and submitted in PDF format.\nQuestion: Given that the document contains nonbinding recommendations, are regulatory authorities open to alternative submission formats such as Quarto/Rmd/md for document generation and accepting rendered documents in formats like html?\nSituation: Once challenges 1 and 2 have been addressed, the regulator will require analysis results metadata for all tables in the submission, available in the define.xml. This metadata includes essential information for recreating specific analysis results, presented in a standard format, encompassing the analysis dataset, selection criteria, primary variable, and model statements.\nQuestion: Is it within the purview of this group to tackle challenges 1 and 2 and devise methods to provide the analysis metadata (essentially creating a new ADRG template)?\nSituation: It is essential to review the requirements of other regulatory agencies regarding software and programs.\nQuestion: We should also verify the requirements of other agencies such as the European Medicines Agency (EMA), the Chinese National Medical Products Administration (NMPA), the Japanese Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA), and so forth.\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nFDA Study Data Technical Conformance Guide (version 5.7): FDA Study Data Technical Conformance Guide\nAnalysis Data Reviewer’s Guide (ADRG) Package: Analysis Data Reviewer’s Guide (ADRG) Package\nR Consortium Pilot 3 ADRG: R Consortium Pilot 3 ADRG\nInstructions to Programs in R: Instructions to Programs in R"

Needs discussion for supporting hybrid approaches (various languages).\n\nLovemore (and Sam P.) to get in contact with Christine R. We can still invite Christine to future meetings as needed.\n\nWe need to know what the specific changes we want to see updated in the ADRG for open-source submissions as well as the process for submitting updates.\nWe need to know Christine’s preferred method for collaboration.\nWe want to understand the submission process for approval of the updated template.\nWe also want to know the distribution methods for the approved template for the public to use (e.g. Sponsor, Pinnacle 21, CDISC).\n\nStatus: Lovemore has already emailed Christine, and we’re awaiting her response on how to proceed with the ADRG template review and future collaboration.\n\nIdentify sections P21 populates and doesn’t populate in the ADRG.\n\nJoel to review and plan for automation contribution.\n\nStatus - Ongoing. Team is encouraged to review the draft specification by Joel and we can discuss in our next scheduled meeting.\n\n\nContact Chris Price to find P21 and CDISC core contacts to see if we can get a meeting with them.\n\nNick’s feedback from communications with Chris Price:\nTo avoid endorsing proprietary software, Chris recommends not collaborating with Pinnacle 21. Instead, we should develop an open and flexible solution that doesn’t lock sponsors into a specific vendor. Ultimately, we aim to provide a solution that adheres to CDISC core principles while allowing sponsors the freedom to integrate it seamlessly into their existing workflows.\nAction: To ensure our approach aligns with industry standards, we’ll invite Sam Hume to explain the role of CDISC core. This will help us integrate CDISC standards into our solution effectively.\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion Topics\n\nConfirm collaboration method with Christine R.\n\nStatus: ongoing\n\nNick to give update on PHUSE/FDA Computational Science Symposium (CSS) potential slot to have a breakout session:\n\nNick reached out to the organizers and it was agreed that at the moment the breakout session will focus on the use of TEAL: industry adoption and the collaborative unified ecosystem.\nAction: Discuss with team to decide whether we need a breakout session and if it’s going to be in the EU or US or both session?\n\nDecide on moving Pilot 3 adrg.qmd (further discussion needed).\n\nAction: create a repository and use pilot3 or pilot 4 ADRG as starting template.\n\nhttps://github.com/RConsortium/submissions-pilot4-webR/\n\n\nTemplatize open-source unpacking/re-executing analysis instructions.\n\nDiscussions:\n\nOS computing environment: The idea of having an OS computing environment was discussed but dismissed as not currently viable due to legal and independence concerns for regulatory authorities.\n\nAccumulus Synergy: A similar initiative, Accumulus Synergy, was mentioned (Home - Accumulus Synergy). This platform provides a secure way for life sciences organizations and regulatory authorities to exchange information and collaborate.\nScope: It was decided that further exploration of these ideas is outside the current scope and can be revisited after the first deliverable.\n\n\nAction: Start on draft of an open-source unpacking/re-executing analysis instructions template. (when?)\n\n\n\n\nAction Items:\n\nPHUSE ADRG Collaboration: Follow-up with Christine. (When: ASAP)\nCSS Breakout Session:\n\nDecide whether a breakout session is needed.\nIf yes, decide whether it will be EU, US, or both.\nDeadline: Before December 18th meeting.\nCommunicate decision to: Nick.\n\nADRG Development & Review:\n\nCreate a repository: Use pilot3 or pilot4 ADRG as a starting template.\nReview metadata programming specifications: Provide feedback on specifications.\nIdentify P21 population in ADRG: Identify sections P21 populates and doesn’t populate.\nStart drafting a template for open-source unpacking/re-executing analysis instructions.\nDeadline for all the above: Before December 18th meeting (work can begin immediately).\n\nAutomation Contribution Strategy:\n\nTask: Develop an initial draft of the automation contribution strategy.\nDeadline: Before December 18th meeting.\n\n\nFuture:\n\nTo ensure our approach aligns with industry standards, we’ll invite Sam Hume to explain the role of CDISC core.

    "text": "16Apr2025\nAttendees: Lovemore Gakava, Nicholas Masel, Eric Nantz, Sam Parmar\nGuest(s): N/A\nFacilitator: Joel Laxamana\n\nSummary:\nUpdates were provided on ongoing projects related to the development of the CSS presentation and the ADRG package. L Gakava mentioned the creation of a draft document in Google Drive, which will be refined and shared for feedback. The discussion highlighted challenges with core variables in defined files, noting that different companies have varying practices. Joel emphasized the importance of maintaining standardization in outputs from Pinnacle 21, while the group recognized the need for collaboration to effectively address these challenges.\nThe team discussed the selection of core variables and the complexities of mapping functions to R packages. Joel shared his approach to managing R packages, including lock files and session information, while L Gakava is developing a generalized function based on team feedback. Sam pointed out that static code analysis may not be sufficient for mapping, referencing LogRx as an example. The conversation underscored the necessity of working with the consortium group to streamline package documentation and ensure clarity in the purpose of dependency information in submissions.\nFurther discussions focused on the development of a supplementary guidance document for the ADRG and the structure of the ADRG completion guidelines. L Gakava proposed a template for R code usage, while Joel suggested including auto-reproducibility steps in the completion guide. The team acknowledged the need for flexibility in their R package to accommodate varying sponsor approaches and emphasized the importance of aligning their methods with evolving industry standards. Concerns were raised about the impact of changes in Pinnacle 21 on their processes, leading to a suggestion to involve a technical expert from Pinnacle 21 to enhance collaboration and ensure their tools remain relevant.\n\n\nAction Items:\n\nL Gakava will refine the outline for the upcoming CSS presentation and circulate it for comments.\nL Gakava will share the generalized function for core variables with the group for feedback.\nJoel Laxamana will list out the R packages needed for the project and test the function to ensure it works correctly.\nJoel Laxamana will follow up with Christine to clarify the information needed for the ADRG versus the R completion package.\nEric Nantz will disable some actions in the project until the team is in a better position to start checking.\n\n\n\nKey Questions:\n\nWhat is the timeline for refining the outline for the CSS presentation?\nAre we still in agreement on putting the information in the supplementary document?\nWhat are the input artifacts needed to do this work?\nHow will the team ensure that the functions developed will meet the needs of both the ADRG and the R completion package?"

Joel Laxamana addressed the ongoing migration to new systems and the need for accurate documentation, while Lovemore Gakava and Piotr Pasza Storożenko expressed enthusiasm for collaboration. The team reviewed action items from the previous meeting, including responsibilities for compiling necessary packages and clarifying guidance documents.\nThe group delved into the specifics of the Analysis Data Reviewer Guide (ADRG), discussing the conversion of SAS code to TXT for pilot studies and the acceptable use of R syntax for submissions. They examined the distinctions between various sections of the ADRG, emphasizing the need for clarity in documentation. Piotr Pasza Storożenko and Eric Nantz agreed on the importance of including both package names and functions in the documentation, particularly for FDA reviewers who predominantly use Windows. The conversation also covered the management of system dependencies and the challenges posed by different operating systems.\nRegulatory submission practices were a key topic, with Nicholas Masel questioning the necessity of converting .R files to .txt formats. Eric Nantz clarified that .R files are compliant with ECTD specifications, addressing previous confusion. The team discussed the implications of using zip files for packaging submissions, noting that while some instances were accepted, regulatory discussions are ongoing.\nL Gakava encouraged the use of RStudio and R Markdown for documentation, while the team agreed on the importance of maintaining simple and accessible documentation practices. The meeting concluded with plans for future collaboration and contributions to open-source initiatives.\n\n\nAction Items:\n\nJoel Laxamana will make sure to put up the meeting minutes from last week, including the current meeting notes.\nJoel Laxamana will list out the other packages needed for the project and test functions to ensure they work correctly.\nEric Nantz will disable some actions in the project until the team is in a better position to start checking.\nLovemore Gakava will draw up the outline for the CSS presentation and share it with the team before the next meeting.\nLovemore Gakava will summarize the previous meeting with the FDA and discuss it in the next meeting.\n\nKey Questions:\n\nHow will the team ensure that the functions developed will meet the needs of both the ADRG and the R ADRG completion guideline package?\nHow will the team document the functions and packages used in the ADRG?\nWhat are the key takeaways from the previous meeting with the FDA?"

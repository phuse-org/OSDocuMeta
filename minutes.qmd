## 04Sep2024

**Attendees:** Lovemore Gakava, Nicholas Masel, Steven Haesendonckx, Joel Laxamana, Hanming Tu\
**Facilitator:** Joel Laxamana

#### Agenda :

1.  Introduce ourselves and what we want to get out of this WG.
2.  Discuss and decide how we want to start this off and pick a template document we want to work with first (e.g. ADRG).
3.  How we want to track our work (e.g. github project board - create issues and self-assign to the work we feel comfortable doing)
4.  Frequency of our catch-ups to get status updates on work.
5.  Discuss FDA quarterly meeting presentation :

Hope this time works for you. If not, please let me know. First action is to create a set of slides to present at FDA quarterly meeting : 16 October at 14:00 BST. I was thinking we can create quarto md slides.

#### Discussion/Issues/Actions :

1.  KO meeting 04Sep2024.
2.  First draft of slides due 13Sep2024 (or sooner).

-   Intro : List out the current ADRG template we have now and how we want to update the template to include open-source metadata - Lovemore
-   Within the current ADRG from Pinnacle 21 vs an ADRG where Open-source submission was used, list out the differences and note these differecnes as the updates we want to make to the current ADRG template to be Open-Source friendly.
    -   e.g., List out all of the tables in this ADRG, [here](https://github.com/RConsortium/submissions-pilot3-adam-to-fda/blob/main/m5/datasets/rconsortiumpilot3/analysis/adam/datasets/adrg.pdf), that we can automate and generate sourcing available metadata
        -   1.2 Study Data Standards and Dictionary Inventory (Can this come from the TS SDTM domain?)
        -   3.1 Core Variables (come from the define.xml specificaions)
        -   4.2 Data Dependencies (may need to some code scraping to read through each ADaM program and identify any other ADaMs being sourced in to create the ADaM)
        -   5.2 Analysis Datasets (read in all of the .xpts in the submission package to extract the metadata for each ADaM to fill in this table)
        -   6.2 Issues Summary (extract report from P21)
        -   7.2 ADaM Programs (read in all of the .xpts in the submission package to extract the list of ADaMs and it's label for each ADaM to fill in this table)
        -   7.3 Analysis Output Programs (this one may be tricky as there are many study specific Selection Criteria to include)
        -   7.4 Proprietary R Packages (Joel has some code for this, in R, essentially using SessionInfo() and {renv})
        -   eCTD structure.
-   With these listed updates we want to make, we can utilize metadata to help fill in this information in the ADRG (Let's list write out specifications as to where )
-   Challenge the file format delivered to the FDA, not only .pdf, but can we additionally submit .qmd files (or other file formats) as well so that the ADRG can be reproduced on the Agency side to help better click on code from the ADRG to help execute. Note : [eCTD specifications](https://www.fda.gov/media/85816/download) say we can submit .qmd for analysis, but can we also submit it as a form of ADRG documentation.
-   Do we want to bring up the possibility of creating an open-source package for this to help automate the use of metadata in the ADRG documentation.

3.  Review and Feedback due 20Sep2024.

-   Things to think about :
    -   We want this template to be able to support multiple open-source languages. Currently, R is the go-to in Clinical Trial submission now in the industry for open-source. Do we want to create an ADRG based on R as first go or do we want to add the complexity of having to think about multiple open-source programming languages? It would be good to keep the template as simple and user-friendly as possible. Have a think offline.

#### Actions:

4.  Update and finalize slides due 27Sep2024.
5.  Practice presentation due TBD (anytime between 4 & 6)
6.  Present 16Oct2024

#### **New topics brought up with Christine R.**

-   Collaboration with Christine Rossin on reviewing the ADRG:

    -   Christine shared the current ADRG that is in review (unfortunatley public review has been closed, but we are asking for inclusion in the ADRG review).

    -   We then shared our Project WG 'Mission Statement' and the RCRSWG Pilot 3 ADRG with Christine to review, where some feedback from her included :

        -   Exclude eCTD directory structure.

        -   ADRG is an m5 directive, no need to mention m1 folder.

        -   P21 pre-populates some ADRG sections, but some require manual sponsor updates.

        -   Collaborating with P21 to improve metadata provision for the ADRG.

#### **Actions**

-   Identify sections P21 populates and doesn't populate in the ADRG.

    -   Joel to review and plan for automation contribution.

-   Determine how to contribute to automation for new ADRG versions. Needs discussion for supporting hybrid approaches (various languages).

    -   Lovemore (and Sam P.) to get in contact with Christine R. We can still invite Christine to future meetings as needed.

        -   We need to know what the specific changes we want to see updated in the ADRG for open-source submissions as well as the process for submitting updates.

        -   We need to know Christine's preferred method for collaboration.

        -   We want to understand the submission process for approval of the updated template.

        -   We also want to know the distribution methods for the approved template for the public to use (e.g. Sponsor, Pinnacle 21, CDISC).

-   Further potential support from other Novo colleagues

    -   Lovemore to provide colleague's contact information for joining the WG.

-   Contact Chris Price to find P21 and CDISC core contacts to see if we can get a meeting with them.

    -   *Nick's feedback from communications with Chris Price:*

        *To avoid endorsing proprietary software, Chris recommends not collaborating with Pinnacle 21. Instead, we should develop an open and flexible solution that doesn't lock sponsors into a specific vendor. Ultimately, we aim to provide a solution that adheres to CDISC core principles while allowing sponsors the freedom to integrate it seamlessly into their existing workflows.*

    -   *Action: To ensure our approach aligns with industry standards, we'll invite Sam Hume to explain the role of CDISC core. This will help us integrate CDISC standards into our solution effectively.*

#### **Discussion Topics**

-   Confirm collaboration method with Christine R.

    -   *Status: ongoing*

-   Nick to give update on PHUSE/FDA Computational Science Symposium (CSS) potential slot to have a breakout session:

    -   *Nick reached out to the organizers and it was agreed that at the moment the breakout session will focus on the use of TEAL: industry adoption and the collaborative unified ecosystem.*

    -   *Action: Discuss with team to decide whether we need a breakout session and if it's going to be in the EU or US or both session?*

-   Decide on moving Pilot 3 adrg.qmd (further discussion needed).

    -   *Action: create a repository and use pilot3 or pilot 4 ADRG as starting template.*

        -   [*https://github.com/RConsortium/submissions-pilot4-webR/*](https://github.com/RConsortium/submissions-pilot4-webR/)

-   Templatize open-source unpacking/re-executing analysis instructions.

    -   *Discussions:*

        -   ***OS computing environment:** The idea of having an OS computing environment was discussed but dismissed as not currently viable due to legal and independence concerns for regulatory authorities.*
            -   ***Accumulus Synergy:** A similar initiative, Accumulus Synergy, was mentioned ([Home - Accumulus Synergy](https://www.accumulus.org/)). This platform provides a secure way for life sciences organizations and regulatory authorities to exchange information and collaborate.*
            -   ***Scope:** It was decided that further exploration of these ideas is outside the current scope and can be revisited after the first deliverable.*

#### **Discussion Topics:**

#### Meeting Update - Discussion with Christine

Christine joined the last 20 minutes of the meeting (thanks to Sam's invitation). During her time, we reviewed Hye Soo's comments and discussed the following key points:

#### Key Discussion Points

Regarding Section 7 (Appendix: Instructions to Execute Analysis Programs in R):

-    Christine recommends moving this to a separate supporting document

-   The ADRG template should remain software-neutral

-    We should develop separate completion guidelines for different software (R, SAS, and potential future additions)

#### Next Steps

We need to include Christine in upcoming meetings to determine who will take ownership of writing the R completion guideline and discuss further the content of the template and the R completion guideline.
